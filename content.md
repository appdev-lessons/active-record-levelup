# ActiveRecord Querying: LevelUp

Get some more querying practice with this game we built:

[levelup.firstdraft.com](https://levelup.firstdraft.com/)

The levels are not graded, so don't worry about getting points here. Just have some fun getting practice with querying.

Some tips:

- Your task for each level is in bold at the top of the page.
- Below that, you can see the structure of the database (the "schema") i.e., all of the tables and what columns each table has.
  - At the bottom of each table, you can click "view data" to see the actual records in the table.
- Below the schema on the left is a grey box containing a mini-lesson describing a method or technique that will be helpful for the task.
  - At the bottom of the grey box, you can click "view examples" to see a few ways of writing the method.
- Below the schema on the right are the model files. You can modify them (e.g. to define an instance method) if you want to.
- Below the models is a box to enter your query. The box will grow if you add multiple lines (e.g. to create intermediate variables). When you click "Run", the  return value of the last line is what will be used as your result.
- After you click "Run", there will be a banner below indicating whether you passed the task or not.
  - The banner will tell you the **class** of the value that your code returned. Pay attention to it.
  - You can click "error details" to see more information about why the tests didn't pass.
- Below the banner, the actual value that was returned will be displayed (you can also find this value in the error details, under "got").
- For the last level (many to many), a hint: recall that [you can give .where an Array of criteria (as opposed to a single value) and it will return a Relation containing all the records that match any of the values in the Array](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/130-contact-book-first-database#using-where-with-an-array-of-criteria).

Good luck! Ask lots of questions!

- What is the name of the level you completed up to (enter "all" if you made it all the way through)?
{: .free_text #what_level title="What level did you reach?" points="1" answer="any" }
